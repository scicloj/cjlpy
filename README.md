# cjlpy

Using Python from Clojure - experimental.

## Usage

Make sure that jep is installed (e.g., `pip3 install jep`). Then, set the environment variable `JEP_LIBRARY_PATH` to the path that contains the jep binaries. It should be something like `/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/jep/`.

Then, `lein repl` and look at the [tests](./test/cjlpy/core_test.clj).
